# WAT

Yet partial implementation of the OpenVPN plugin in MVC style ( not legacy ) offering API interface to automate things.

Yet it includes

 - CCD / client specific overides CRUD operations
 
**This plugin is NOT transparent to the GUI part of openvpn (legacy) which handles `Client Specific Overides`. So you 
want to use the openvpn GUI for CSO or this Web-API. You can use all other GUI aspects though**
 
## Installation

You should install / use it along the core openvpn "plugin" - consider this plugin as a addition.

On your opnsense box do

```bash
setenv openvpn_version 0.0.5
curl -Lo os-openvpn-devel-${openvpn_version}.txz https://github.com/EugenMayer/opnsense-openvpn-plugin/raw/master/dist/os-openvpn-devel-${openvpn_version}.txz
pkg add os-openvpn-devel-${openvpn_version}.txz
```

## Using the API

## Development

### Start

No magic involved here, fires up a vagrant build on the recent [opnsense-build](https://app.vagrantup.com/eugenmayer/boxes/opnsense)

```
make start
```

1. You see the plugin deployed in the opnsense instance, access it by https://localhost:10443
2. If you change code, just run `make sync_plugin`
3. Its all on you now :)

### Stop ( pause )
To stop the vm ( not losing state, continue later )
```   
make stop
```

### Rm ( end, remove all )
To remove the VM
```
make rm
```

## During development

### Plugins
